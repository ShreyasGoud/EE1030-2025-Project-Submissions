# Image Compression with SVD Library (Full C Implementation)
## ABOUT
* This project is done under the Prof. GVV Sharma for the  course Matrix Theory (EE1030).
---
* The project is done using full C implementation both for Image handling and computing the Compression for grayscale (single channel images) with the help of open-source libraries stb_image.h and stb_image_write.h.
---
## Features

* **Image Ready:** Handles 2D data (like an image channel) and returns the compressed result.
* **Optimized Reading:** Handles the input and output in full C implementation.

---

## Acknowledgments & Dependencies
The full C implementation for grayscale images uses the single-header libraries stb_image.h and stb_image_write.h by Sean Barrett. These libraries handle image loading and saving, and they were essential for creating a complete solution in pure C.
