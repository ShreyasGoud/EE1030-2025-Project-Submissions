\begin{abstract}
This paper details the design, implementation, and validation of a temperature measurement system using a PT100 resistance temperature detector (RTD), a high-precision ADS1115 ADC, and an Arduino microcontroller. The system employs a differential voltage reading from a simple divider circuit for signal acquisition. A quadratic model, $V = aT^2 + bT + c$, was derived using the Least Squares method on a training dataset. This model was then validated against a separate, unseen dataset to verify its accuracy. The final calibrated temperature is displayed on a JHD 162A parallel LCD, creating a validated and accurate measurement device.

\section{Introduction}
Accurate temperature measurement is critical in various scientific and industrial applications. While many sensors exist, platinum resistance thermometers like the PT100 offer high accuracy and stability over a wide temperature range. However, their small resistance change necessitates precise measurement techniques. This project moves beyond the Arduino's internal ADC by interfacing with an external 16-bit ADS1115 ADC to achieve higher resolution. This paper presents the hardware setup, the software implementation, and the mathematical modeling used to calibrate the system for optimal accuracy.

\section{Hardware Setup}
The components used to construct the temperature measurement system are listed in Table \ref{table:list}. The complete circuit schematic is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:schematic}. The key connections for the ADC and LCD are detailed in Table \ref{table:ads_connections} and Table \ref{table:lcd_connections}.

\section{Role of the ADS1115 ADC}
The ADS1115 is a high-precision, 16-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter that serves as the core measurement component of the system. Its primary role is to overcome the significant limitations of the Arduino's built-in 10-bit ADC for this specific application.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Resolution}: A 10-bit ADC has $2^{10}$ (1,024) steps of resolution. The 16-bit ADS1115 has $2^{16}$ (65,536) steps. This 64-fold increase in resolution allows it to detect the tiny, microvolt-level changes produced by the PT100 sensor, which would be completely lost in the quantization noise of the Arduino's internal ADC.
    \item \textbf{Differential Measurement}: The circuit is specifically configured to read the voltage difference between the ADC's A0 and A1 channels. This differential reading, performed by the \texttt{ads.readADC\_Differential\_0\_1()} function, is crucial for reducing common-mode noise. Electrical noise from the power supply or other environmental sources tends to affect both input lines equally. A differential amplifier rejects this common noise and only measures the true signal, leading to a much cleaner and more stable reading.
    \item \textbf{Programmable Gain}: The ADS1115 contains a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA). The code sets this internal amplifier's gain to 8x using \texttt{ads.setGain(GAIN\_EIGHT)}. This amplifies the small voltage from the circuit before it is digitized, ensuring the signal uses a larger portion of the ADC's full 16-bit range and further improving the effective resolution. For a gain of 8x, the measurable voltage range is $\pm0.512$V.
    \item \textbf{Voltage Conversion}: The raw digital value from the ADC (\texttt{adc\_raw}) is converted back into a real-world voltage using a specific multiplier based on the gain. For a gain of 8x, the multiplier is 0.015625 millivolts per bit. The code applies this conversion to get the final voltage (\texttt{v\_out}) used in the temperature calculation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Software Implementation}
The system's logic is implemented in C++ using the Arduino IDE. The code is responsible for initializing the ADS1115 ADC and the LCD, reading the differential voltage, applying the quadratic model to calculate temperature, and displaying the result. A moving average filter is used to smooth the output. The complete source code can be found at: \\

\section{Mathematical Modeling and Validation}
\subsection{Model Training}
To calibrate the sensor, a quadratic model of the form $V = aT^2 + bT + c$ was fitted to an empirical training dataset, which is provided in Table \ref{table:training_data}. The coefficients were determined using a Python script employing a custom Least Squares function.

The derived coefficients are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a = 1.7826 \times 10^{-5}$
    \item $b = 1.4987 \times 10^{-3}$
    \item $c = 0.1570$
\end{itemize}

To convert the measured voltage ($V$) back to temperature ($T$), the quadratic formula is used by first rearranging the equation to $aT^2 + bT + (c - V) = 0$. Solving for T gives:
\\[10pt]
$T = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4a(c - V)}}{2a}$
\\[10pt]

The plot of the training data against the fitted parabolic curve is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:training_plot}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Validation}
The accuracy of the trained model was verified using a separate validation dataset (Table \ref{table:validation_data}) that was not used during training. The model's predictions for the validation data points were compared against their true temperature values. The results, shown in Table \ref{table:validation_results}, indicate a close agreement between predicted and actual temperatures, confirming the model's validity. The graphical representation of this validation is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:validation_plot}.

\section{Conclusion}
This project successfully demonstrates the construction and calibration of a high-precision temperature sensor. The use of a quadratic model derived from a Least Squares fit proved to be an effective method for converting raw voltage data into accurate temperature readings. The model's performance was successfully verified against an independent validation dataset, confirming its reliability. However, it was noted that the noise in power input has caused discrepencies in readings, which can be avoided by using as instrumentation amplifier before being connected to the ADS1115 module, to cancel out the noise.
